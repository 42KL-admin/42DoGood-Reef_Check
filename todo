Certainly! Let's break down the implementation into smaller milestones to make it more manageable. We'll start by implementing each step one at a time:

### Milestone 1: Implement `ImageUploadComponent`

1. Create a new file `ImageUploadComponent.js`.
2. Inside `ImageUploadComponent.js`, implement a functional component `ImageUploadComponent` that takes `label` and `onImageUpload` as props.
3. Add an `<input type="file" />` element to handle image uploads.
4. Export the `ImageUploadComponent`.

### Milestone 2: Implement `useRowState` Custom Hook

1. Create a new file `useRowState.js`.
2. Inside `useRowState.js`, implement a custom hook `useRowState` that manages state for a row.
3. The state should include fields for `substrateImage`, `fishInvertImage`, `uploadError`, and `conversionStatus`.
4. Implement functions to handle image uploads, conversion, and resetting the state.
5. Export the `useRowState` hook.

### Milestone 3: Use `useRowState` in `RowComponent`

1. Open `RowComponent.js`.
2. Import the `useRowState` hook.
3. Replace the local state logic in `RowComponent` with the `useRowState` hook.
4. Update event handlers (`handleImageUpload`, `handleConvert`, `handleDelete`) to use the functions provided by the hook.
5. Ensure that the UI elements in `RowComponent` (buttons, error messages, etc.) reflect the state managed by `useRowState`.

### Milestone 4: Test `RowComponent` in Isolation

1. Create a simple test or use a temporary Next.js page to test the functionality of `RowComponent`.
2. Verify that image uploads, conversion, and deletion work as expected.

### Milestone 5: Implement `ImageUploadContainer`

1. Create a new file `ImageUploadContainer.js`.
2. Inside `ImageUploadContainer.js`, implement a functional component `ImageUploadContainer`.
3. Import `RowComponent` and `useRowState`.
4. Manage an array of rows using `useState` in `ImageUploadContainer`.
5. Implement functions for adding and deleting rows.
6. Pass appropriate props to `RowComponent`.
7. Export the `ImageUploadContainer`.

### Milestone 6: Test `ImageUploadContainer`

1. Create a new Next.js page or use an existing one.
2. Import and use the `ImageUploadContainer` component.
3. Test the functionality of adding and deleting rows.

### Milestone 7: Style and Refine

1. Add styling to improve the visual appearance of your components.
2. Refine the UI and user experience based on your design preferences.
3. Ensure responsiveness and accessibility.

### Milestone 8: Integration with Conversion Logic

1. Implement the conversion logic within `RowComponent` or a separate utility function.
2. Test the conversion logic by passing mock functions for `onConvert` to `RowComponent`.
3. Ensure that the conversion status and errors are displayed correctly.

### Milestone 9: Final Testing

1. Test the complete flow by uploading images, converting, and deleting rows.
2. Handle any edge cases or error scenarios.
3. Verify that the components work together seamlessly.

By breaking down the implementation into these smaller milestones, you can approach the development in a systematic way. Focus on one milestone at a time, ensuring that each step is implemented correctly before moving on to the next one.
